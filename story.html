  <h4> SUMMARY:</h4>
  <p class="text">In the picturesque village of Jumrikada, nestled within the breathtaking landscapes of the Pyuthan
    district, a remarkable girl named Sushila Neupane began her journey. Born into a family of seven, Sushila was the
    embodiment of honesty, innocence, and emotional strength. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity, and her spirit remained
    unbroken despite the challenges life had in store for her.

    Sushila's family was a microcosm of the community—tight-knit and harmonious. Jhagindralal Neupane, Sushila's father,
    was renowned in the village for his unwavering honesty and dedication to his family. A man of principles, he took
    pride in being not just a provider but an honest son, husband, and father. Debaka Neupane, Sushila's mother, was the
    epitome of a devoted housewife, creating a warm and nurturing environment for her children.

    As the Neupane family reveled in the natural beauty surrounding Jumrikada, life took an unexpected turn. The
    serenity of their home was shattered when financial difficulties struck. Jhagindralal, once a pillar of strength,
    found
    solace in the bottom of a bottle, and the tranquility of their household began to crumble.

    Sushila, still in the bloom of her youth, became a silent witness to the gradual decay of her family. The idyllic
    village now echoed with hushed arguments and the stifled cries of a broken home. Sushila's innocence couldn't shield
    her from the harsh reality of domestic violence that unfolded before her eyes. The vibrant colors of her world
    turned to shades of gray as her family faced the wrath of her father's inner demons.

    In the face of adversity, Sushila clung to her unwavering strength. She sought refuge in the beauty of the village
    that had once been her haven. Amidst the green hills and flowing rivers, she found moments of solace, allowing her
    togather the emotional fortitude needed to face each day.

    Despite the turmoil, Sushila remained committed to her education. School became a sanctuary—a place where her dreams
    could flourish. Her academic achievements became a testament to her resilience, a lifeline that offered hope in the
    darkest of times.

    Jumrikada, with its stunning vistas and close-knit community, became both witness and silent supporter of Sushila's
    journey. Through perseverance and an indomitable spirit, she not only overcame the shadows of domestic violence but
    also emerged as a source of inspiration for others in similar struggles.

    Sushila's story is not just about the trials she faced but also the strength she discovered within herself. The girl
    who once walked through the fields of Jumrikada with dreams in her eyes grew into a beacon of hope, proving that
    even in the most challenging circumstances, the human spirit can rise above, shining brightly against the backdrop
    of
    life's uncertainties.
